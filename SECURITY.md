# Security Audit — Trestle DeFi
# Security Policy

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it privately via **contact@trestle.website**. Do not open public GitHub issues for security bugs.

## Bug Bounty

We run a bug bounty program with tiered rewards. All hNOBT rewards are 10× the base rate.

**To claim rewards:** Join [reward.trestle.website](https://reward.trestle.website), submit your vulnerability report, and complete verification.

### Submission Format

1. **Vulnerability Title**
2. **Steps to Reproduce**
3. **Proof of Concept** (Amoy Testnet tx hash or code)

### Response Timeline

- Acknowledgement: 48 hours
- Triage: 7 days
- Reward: 14 days after validation

### Reward Tiers

| Severity | Target Systems & Scope | hNOBT Reward | xGov Reward | Payout Release |

### Sybil-Defense Rules

1. **Proof-of-Concept Requirement:** No S1, S2, or S3 bug bounty points will be logged without an accompanying active **Polygon Amoy Testnet Transaction Hash** or a valid, reproducible local code fork.

2. **Retention Rule:** Growth referrals are only counted if the incoming users pass Trestle Telegram/Discord captcha gate and stay active for at least 72 hours.

3. **Multi-Account Rule:** If two different profiles (e.g., Joe and Cress) submit identical bugs or referral lists, the payout is split 50/50 or canceled entirely pending identity verification.

### Payout Options

Join [reward.trestle.website](https://reward.trestle.website) to validate and claim rewards. Two options:

| Option | Requirements | Bug Bounty Payout |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| **A: Full Reward** | Stage 1 (Gitcoin Passport + Accounts) + Stage 2 (Biometric) | **100% hNOBT + 100% xGov** |
| **B: Early Withdrawal** | Stage 1 (Gitcoin Passport + Accounts) only | **50% hNOBT + 0 xGov** |

## Scope

**In:** Smart contracts, frontend, verification logic, public APIs

**Out:** UI/UX, missing features, third-party integrations, social engineering, private/internal code
